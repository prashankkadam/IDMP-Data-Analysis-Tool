Kindly follow the following SOP to update the performance report:

1 - Replacing the data:
	a - First copy the file from Commercial drive->Ops (General)->2020->Bunker Planning IMO_2020_ver_5.xslx into the data 
		folder. This file will have the updated operator comments.
	b - Now extract the remaining on board data from MSPS web reports (Variant-> ADA_139 IMO 2020). Copy the file in the 
		data folder in our IMO 2020 directory.
	c - Copy the content of the remaining on board file and paste it as values in the RemainingOnBoard_Raw sheet of the file
		copied from Commercial drive.
	d - In the IMO _2020_Dont_Edit, firstly unprotect the sheet by right clicking on the sheet name and click Unprotect Sheet
		Enter the password 'imo2020imo'.
	e - Copy the ROB date(Column H) and Re-delivery Date(Column G) and paste them as values.
	f - Select all the empty boxes in Columns ROB Date(Column H) and HS HFO[tons](Column I) and hit the delete button. This 
		will delete the excel formula links in the cells and won't give an error while pandas is trying to read it.
	g - Delete the redelivered ships data present at the bottom of the IMO _2020_Dont_Edit sheet.
	h - In the Operator(Column A), delete all the cells who have value as 0, do this for IMO _2020_Dont_Edit and 
		Monthly_Consumption _Trend sheet. 
	i - Save all the changes. Delete the old IMO_2020 file and the Remaining_on_Board file. Rename the 
		Bunker Planning IMO_2020_ver_5.xslx to IMO_2020.xlsx
		
2 - Run the app.py file, a URL will appear in your console if the file runs successfully. Open the URL in your browser and 
	you will be able to see the dashboard.

3 - Updating in heroku:
	a - Open terminal(in Pycharm, it is one of the tabs in the bottom of the screen) and navigate to the directory containing
		the IMO 2020 dashboard code(IMO_2020)
	b - In the commandline type - "git status", you will see a list of all the data files that you have changed, in red.
	c - Now type - "git add .", this will add all the data to the commit.
	d - To crosscheck, again type - "git status", all the filenames will now appear in green. This means that they are ready
		to commit, if any of the files appears red it is probably open in some other location so close it and try again.
	e - Now commit the code by typing - "git commit -m "Data Update""
	f - Finally will push our changes to heroku - "git push heroku master"
